This module exists to validate the pluggable UUID generation architecture. You
should not use this module in production environments as it spews out warnings
similar to this:
Deprecated function: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated in 
drupal_load() (line 932 of /.../includes/bootstrap.inc).

See http://drupal.org/node/1171836 for more information.

You've been warned.
